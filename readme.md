completely a work in progress, i have absolutely no direction whatsoever here, yadda yadda

### using the uwinsite scraper
the demo is at `uwinsite/demo.py`. to run, use 
```bash
python3 demo.py id="your session id" search="search term"
```
the session id is stored in your cookies. 

in chrome, the easiest way to get it is by opening the developer tools, going to the application tab, then cookies, then student.uwindsor.ca, then copying the entry for `psprdweb-PORTAL-PSJSESSIONID`. 

you might have to perform a search manually/using uwinsite to "activate" the key.
