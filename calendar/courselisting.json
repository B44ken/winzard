Students look to historical and contemporary ideas about borders that have been articulated in various disciplines: from political theory and cultural geography, to urban planning, art, literature, architectural and spatial theory. (Open to majors and non-majors.) (Prerequisites: MACS-2140 and MACS-2150 for all Visual Arts Majors and semester 4 standing for non-majors.) (Also offered as MACS-4500.)",

This course uses an intersectional framework to consider how variances in race, ethnicity, gender-identity, sexuality, class, citizenship, and culture impact both individual and collective experiences of disability. It considers how Disability Studies differs from other disciplinary approaches to disability, understands disability as a social construct, and positions disability as difference rather than deficit.(Prerequisite: SJST/DISB-1000.)",

Using case studies, students will explore professional intervention strategies that promote full participation and equality for people with disabilities. Other themes include self-determination and choice, supporting disability rights and self- advocacy organizations, and building alliances. Recognizing how important family is to many people with disabilities, this course will also explore the implications of the views and experiences of family members. Stressing the need for empowerment, this course introduces students to social change movements as led by people in search of full citizenship who have disabilities. The implications for empowerment, created by the advent of new technologies, is also explored. (Prerequisite for Social Work/Disability Studies BSW students: DISB 2010.

Students will develop competence as an entry level professional in generalist social work practice within the four contexts of practice: organization, community, social work skills and professional context. Supported by Field Learning Specialists with extensive practice experience and professional social workers, students will develop substantive understanding of social work knowledge, values and skills and demonstrate an understanding of and commitment to the principles which underlie professional social work practice. This course operates as a practicum three days a week in the Fall semester.

This course takes place in the approved field education agency in which the student successfully completed Field Education I (SWRK-4730). Under the continuing supervision of professional social workers, students are expected to develop competencies that go beyond the generic base acquired during Field Education I (SWRK-4730). Students are expected to build upon the knowledge, values and skills acquired in Field Education I to move along the continuum from beginning level social work knowledge to an increasingly complex level of skill development in generalist social work practice. The objectives and competencies outlined in the Field Education II Learning Agreement are minimum expectations for all students. Students will apply professional skills and techniques as well as analytical competence to work with direct and indirect systems in an agency/community setting to develop an understanding of the relationships between human behaviour and societal processes. Students will demonstrate self-awareness and self-discipline sufficient to enable students to apply their knowledge, values, and skills when working with client systems. Supported by Field Learning Specialists, this course will result in the development of critical thinking skills and an inquiring interest in professional issues and knowledge, along with a commitment to the ethical principles of Social Work and the development of a professional identity.

In that context, the course will investigate responses to armed insurrections as well as natural disasters, epidemics, and acute famines that, today, combine humanitarian with militarized responses. The course will also consider how humanitarianism and counterinsurgency warfare draw heavily on academic expertise (e.g. anthropology, sociology, criminology, geography, history, political science, religious studies, and psychology), thus inviting the controversial issue of the relationship between the scholar, the university, and the security apparatus.

Particular themes will be examined, including the nature of learning, patterns of growth and development, the dynamics and complexities of learning in diverse educational contexts, and current educational realities in society. Specifically, students will examine a number of important issues, such as: learning and cognitive processes; personal, social and moral development; individual and group differences; social-cognitive views (e.g., racial discrimination, bullying, harassment, abuse, gender bias, xenophobia, homophobia, stereotyping); motivation and cognition relevant to individual and collective learning; knowledge construction and higher-order thinking. In this course, students will develop a critical awareness of learning theories and related issues and will critique, analyze, and reflect on the underlying assumptions associated with matters and the implications for individual and collective learning in learning organizations.

This course will present students with authentic assessment tasks that situate their on-going inquiries in a context that enables them to apply and further critique what has been previously learned. Students will engage in matters pertaining to learning and learners applicable to research, needs assessment, program review, and policy development, as appropriate. The final project will be grounded in the field experience, and will show evidence of knowledge, skills of inquiry, reflection and problem-solving acquired through the other courses. This course will be taken following completion of the other course- work in the minor option. (Prerequisites: EDUC-4000, EDUC-4050, EDUC-4100, EDUC-4150, EDUC-4200).

Topics such as synaptic vesicle cycling, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and neurological diseases originating at the synapse will be covered. Synapses from both the peripheral and central nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates will be discussed. (Prerequisite: BIOL-2480.) (Recommended for 3000/4000 level student.)

A thorough understanding of the benefits and risks to humans associated with exposure to all forms of ionizing radiation is essential for any medical physicist. This course will review all the forms of ionizing radiation as well as the physics and chemistry of radiation absorption and interactions in the cells of the body. Students will be introduced to the events which have led to our current understanding of the field of radiobiology including in vitro cellular experiments, in vivo animal model experiments, clinical trials on human patients, and nuclear accident/bomb victim exposures. Ultimately, all of the current understanding of radiobiology will be used to explain why the current practice of clinical radiation therapy is practiced as it is by clinical medical physicists and radiation oncologists and how this knowledge can inform future developments in the field.
