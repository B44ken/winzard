NOTIFICATION OF DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO
STATISTICS CANADA
Statistics Canada is the national statistical agency. As such, Statistics Canada carries out hundreds of
surveys each year on a wide range of matters, including education.

It is essential to be able to follow students across time and institutions to understand, for example, the
factors affecting enrollment demand at post-secondary institutions. The increased emphasis on
accountability for public investment means that it is also important to understand ‘outcomes'. In order to
carry out such studies, Statistics Canada asks all colleges and universities to provide data on students and
graduates. Institutions collect and provide to Statistics Canada student identification information
(student's name, student ID number, Social Insurance Number), student contact information (address
and telephone number), student demographic characteristics, enrollment information, previous
education, and labour force activity.

The Federal Statistics Act provides the legal authority for Statistics Canada to obtain access to personal
information held by educational institutions. The information may be used only for statistical purposes,
and the confidentiality provisions of the Statistics Act prevent the information from being released in any
way that would identify a student.

Students who do not wish to have their information used are able to ask Statistics Canada to remove
their identification and contact information from the national database.

Further information on the use of this information can be obtained from Statistics' Canada of visiting
their website at https://www.statcan.gc.ca

VERIFICATION OF OFFICIAL DEGREE PARCHMENTS AND
TRANSCRIPTS AND PREVENTION OF FRAUDULENT
DOCUMENTATION
Degree Verification
The University of Windsor has joined with AuraData, Canada’s online education verification system for
the purposes of verifying degree completion status of University of Windsor graduates.

AuraData is now providing risk prevention in the number one area of résumé fraud, post-
secondary/professional designation education claims. Subscribers to AuraData can now efficiently
confirm the post-secondary education achievement of prospective employees, online 24/7. AuraData
does this while conforming to Federal and Provincial Privacy laws.

Employers can now minimize the hiring risk associated with education fraud so prevalent in the hiring
process. Universities, Colleges and Professional Designations now have a reliable method of assuring the
credibility of their product. Also, graduates are now protected from the illicit use of their designations by
unscrupulous job hunters.

For fast, economical and convenient education verifications for the University of Windsor go to
www.auradata.com or call 416-406-0444 or 1-877-580-2872.

Requests for verification of University of Windsor transcripts or enrolment status, when authorized by
the student, can be directed to the Office of the Registrar by fax at 519-971-3653. Copies of the
document(s) and the student’s signed authorization are required.

Fraudulent University Documentation
Ontario universities are committed to ensuring the integrity of their degrees for their many graduates
and adamantly oppose any activities that result in the creation of fraudulent documents or false
representation of university studies.

Any accusation or indication of document fraud is subject to internal investigation at home institutions in
accordance with legislative frameworks such as internally approved academic honesty policies. While the
universities cannot speak to individual investigations or to any specific individual student file due to
privacy legislation, any such accusations are accorded serious review and attention. Examples of possible
punitive actions might include expulsion, refusal to allow admission and possible legal action.

     •     Publicly funded Ontario universities are members of the Association of Registrars of Universities
           and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC). Members of ARUCC routinely inform other institutions of
           suspicious activity related to fraudulent documentation to uphold the integrity of the Canadian
           educational system. The Council of Ontario Universities is on public record for taking a strong
           position against such inappropriate behaviour.
     •     Many universities in Canada and around the world, including those in Ontario, incorporate
           security features and security protocols when issuing transcripts and diplomas.
     •     The universities urge potential employers, verification agencies and other organizations to
           support the postsecondary sector by requesting that transcripts be sent directly from the
           university rather than accepting student copies, and by verifying all transcripts and diplomas
           with the issuing university.
The verification of University of Windsor degrees is done by the AURADATA degree verification agency.
Contact them at: www.auradata.com

Requests for verification of University of Windsor transcripts or enrolment status, when authorized by
the student, can be directed to the Office of the Registrar by fax at 519-971-3653. Copies of the
document(s) and the student’s signed authorization are required.

   "Withdrawal in good standing. No academic credit."

    Students may not withdraw from a course or courses after the appropriate designated withdrawal
    period. After the voluntary withdrawal period for a course, students remain registered and will be
    assigned grades as appropriate.

    A student who wishes to drop a course or courses after the appropriate withdrawal period based on
    medical or compassionate grounds should refer to "Appeals" or to Senate Bylaw 54.

3) The dates for withdrawal from courses which may result in partial tuition refunds vary from term to

FEE REGULATIONS AND SCHEDULE
The University reserves the right to make changes without prior notice in the various fee schedules, as
well as changes in rules and regulations and the revision or cancellation of particular courses and
programs. The acceptance of fees does not necessarily imply approval of registration.
The following regulations apply to all students.

PAYMENT OF FEES
Fees are due and payable before the commencement of regular term classes. As a convenience, students
may pay their tuition fees at any time prior to the appropriate due date. It is the responsibility of the
student to ensure that deadlines are met. It is the student’s responsibility to be familiar with and
understand all the University regulations contained in the Calendar; to understand how adding and
dropping a course or courses, withdrawal, etc., affects a tuition fee account; and to ensure that tuition
fees are paid in full without any notice from the University. Further, failure to receive a statement of
account through the mail does not constitute a valid reason for non-payment of fees. It is the
responsibility of the student to check their fee account balance details in UWinsite Student at
www.uwindsor.ca/uwinsitestudent. Available methods of payments are available on the Cashiers Office
website at www.uwindsor.ca/finance/student-accounts. You will need your student number and PIN to
access this information.

Cheques or other remittances must be made payable to The University of Windsor and must be received
by the Cashier's Office prior to the due date. The student's name, identification number, address and
telephone number should be recorded in the upper portion of the form of the remittance to ensure that
the records are properly credited.

Students may pay their fees at any chartered bank in Canada by using a bank payment form available at
the Cashier's Office. If a student has a grant and/or loan (e.g., OSAP), the loan must be assigned to the
University to pay the fees. Any known difference between the amount of the award and the fees must be
paid on or before the due date.

Students who are unable to complete payment of fees by the prescribed due date must arrange a fee
deferment. Daily interest charges and academic sanctions (see "Interest Charges on Outstanding
Accounts") may apply. Deferments are permitted under the following circumstances:
(a) a student has evidence of having been awarded a Canada Student Loan or an Ontario Student Loan.
(b) a student has evidence of having been awarded a scholarship, bursary or similar award, which may be
    used to pay the fees.

Students who are sponsored and require invoices to be sent for collection of fees must bring the
appropriate documentation to the Cashiers’ Office.

Notes:
1) It is the responsibility of the student to accurately report his or her academic status and correctly
   calculate the amount owing to the University for fees and other charges. Where calculations are
   incorrect or full payment is not made, daily interest will be charged on balances outstanding after the
   payment due date. Students should check all calculations thoroughly.

    Any errors in a student's academic program, level, and status in Canada must be reported to the
    Office of the Registrar. Any errors which result in the incorrect calculation of fees owing do not relieve
    the student of the responsibility for payment of these fees. Students will be responsible for any
    additional charges incurred as a result of changes in their academic profile for all terms that are
    applicable.

2) It is the responsibility of the student paying his or her fees by cheque to ensure that sufficient funds
   are available to cover any cheques made payable to the University of Windsor. Cheques returned by
   the student's bank for any reason will incur return cheque penalties plus other penalties.

3) Every effort is made to process payments in a timely manner; however, cheques are valid for a period
   of six months and may be cashed at any time during that period.

INTEREST CHARGES ON OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS
A daily interest charge will be calculated on all outstanding accounts. The interest will be compounded
monthly.

A student who has failed to comply with the above regulations may have his or her registration cancelled
as of the date on which the unpaid fees were due.

NON-PAYMENT OF FEES AND CHARGES
Information concerning academic results of any student who has an overdue debt owing to the
University shall be withheld until the debt is settled. This includes transcripts, tuition tax receipts and
diplomas. Overdue accounts which are not settled in a timely manner may be referred to an external
collection agency as deemed necessary by the Cashiers Office.

Students who are graduating and who have an outstanding debt will be permitted to attend
Convocation, but they will not receive their diplomas until all their debts are settled.

Any student who has an overdue debt owing to the University may not be permitted to re-register until
the debt is settled in full by cash, certified cheque, debit card, a money order, bank draft, electronic back
transfer. Students who are settling an overdue account who pay with a personal cheque will have the
hold remain on their account for 30 days (45 days for foreign cheques and drafts) to ensure the cheque
clears the bank. The hold may be lifted upon presentation of a copy of the front and back of the
cancelled cheque.
A student who has not made a satisfactory fee arrangement by the appropriate fee payment due date
(see "Payment of Fees") may be subject to cancellation of his/her registration. Students will be notified
by mail of any cancellations due to non-payment using the most recent address available. Appropriate
charges will be assessed effective the date of cancellation.

Note: Non-payment of fees does not automatically result in the cancellation of registration in a course or
courses.

Any student whose registration has been cancelled for default of payment is required to apply for
reinstatement of registration at the Office of the Registrar. If the application is approved, a $50.00
reinstatement fee is added to any other assessable charges.

Overdue accounts must be paid by cash, certified cheque, or money order.

Any student who has an unresolved grievance concerning fees or other charges may present an
explanatory letter with appropriate official documentation (e.g. doctor's notes, etc.) to the Credit
Manager, Cashier's Office.

TUITION AND EDUCATION CREDIT CERTIFICATE (T2202A)
A tuition and education tax certificate (T2202A) in a form acceptable to the Canadian Customs and
Revenue Agency (CCRA) is available in UWinsite Student at www.uwindsor.ca/uwinsitestudent. This
certificate is made available to all students whose accounts were paid in full by December 31 of the
previous year. Student accounts that are not paid in full will show zero dollars for any semester which
remains unpaid. If a student subsequently pays the semester, revised figures will be made available to
them.

SCHOLARSHIPS

Undergraduate scholarships, awards and/or bursaries offered to students prior to the financial drop date
in each semester, will appear on the UWinsite Student Homepage > Financial Account > Payment History
as “Anticipated Aid”, if the student meets eligibility requirements. Scholarship payments will occur, and
are made directly to the student’s tuition/financial account, after the financial drop date in each
semester (early October for Fall, early February for Winter and mid-July for Summer) should eligibility
requirements continue to be met. Renewable awards will be assigned one semester at a time. Additional
information can be found on the Student Award website: https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentawards/



WITHDRAWAL AND REFUND POLICY
Graduate students who, for any reason, wish to withdraw from the University must notify, in writing, the
Office of Graduate Studies, as otherwise resumption of graduate study at this University may be difficult
or impossible.

Full-time undergraduate students who intend to withdraw completely from the University are required
to undergo an interview and complete the appropriate forms at the Office of Student Development and
Support.
Notice by telephone is not acceptable. Failure to attend classes does not constitute a withdrawal. Full
refund will be given to part-time students enrolled in a course that has been cancelled by the University.
Full and part-time students withdrawing from regular courses during the periods indicated below will be
assessed fees as indicated.

WITHDRAWAL FOR 12-WEEK TERM               FEE PAYABLE

FREE TUITION FOR STUDENTS 65 YEARS OF AGE AND OVER
The University of Windsor offers an incentive of free tuition and incidental fees for students sixty-five
years of age and over, except in the case of professional programs. It is felt that people in this group
might wish to avail themselves of the University facilities, not only for degree purposes, but perhaps for
personal enrichment and the fuller utilization of their leisure time. If you feel that your needs can be
served according to this program, we encourage and invite you to contact the Advising Centre. This
applies to Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents of Canada only.

SCHEDULE OF FEES
The Board of Governors reserves the right to make changes without notice in the published schedule of
fees and charges if, in its opinion, circumstances so require. Any such changes will be reflected in the
Self-Assessment form issued through the Cashier's Office before registration. It is the responsibility of the
student to obtain this information. The schedule of fees changes annually. Contact the Cashier's Office
for information on the current schedule of fees, which outlines tuition, incidental, and other fees. The
current Registrarial Service Fees be found on the Registrar Office website at

STUDENT EXCHANGE
PROGRAMS
The University of Windsor is a party to a number of multilateral and bilateral agreements with
universities in other countries, which permit University of Windsor students to attend other institutions
for periods up to one academic year as part of their degree program at Windsor. Courses taken while
participating under one of these agreements are treated as if they were taken at the University of
Windsor, and do not require a Letter of Permission.

Many agreements are open as to field of study, while others are intended for students in specific
disciplines. In some (but not all) cases proficiency in a second language is required for participation.
Other conditions of eligibility also vary from program to program.

For information on current exchange partner school and application process, contact the Student
Exchange Office or visit their webpage at http://www.uwindsor.ca/studentexchange.
ACADEMIC REGULATIONS
Students are responsible for becoming familiar and complying with the general regulations of the
University as contained in this section. Additionally, students must be familiar and comply with the
regulations of the Faculty in which they are enrolled. These particular requirements may be found in the
program sections of this calendar.

Students also are directed to read the Statement of Responsibility, and the calendar of important dates
and deadlines under posted on the Office of the Registrar under “Important Dates”.

The following policies can be found online on the Central Policies website at: www.uwindsor.ca/policies

     •     Advanced Standing and Credit Transfer (advanced standing and transfer credits reduce the total
           number of courses a student must complete for a degree)
     •     Certificate Programs
     •     Course Equivalency Policy (permission to substitute one course for another)
     •     Course Numbering Policy
     •     Course Overload Policy (course taken in addition to the prescribed semester or term load)
     •     Introductory Statistics Courses
     •     Letters of Permission (permission to take courses at another university for credit towards their
           UWindsor degree)
     •     Policy on Minors (provides a general knowledge of an area of study)
     •     Residency Requirements (the number of courses that must be completed at the University of
           Windsor)
     •     Repetition of Courses
     •     Senior-level Course Requirements (minimum number of courses to be completed at the 200-
           level or above)
     •     Standing Required for Continuation in Programs and for Graduation (minimum major and
           cumulative averages required to continue in a program of study and to graduate)



ACADEMIC ADVISING
The responsibility for becoming familiar and complying with the requirements for degrees and with
academic regulations rests primarily with the student. Every student can access a "Degree Audit Report"
on the Student Self Service page at http://www.uwindsor.ca/current-students which reports a student's
progress towards fulfilling degree requirements. In addition, academic advising is strongly recommended
for all students. Academic units provide individual assistance to students both in the selection of their
programs of studies and in the choice of courses in keeping with program requirements. General
questions normally should be addressed to the Associate Dean of the Faculty.

Students are strongly urged to seek course and program advising to ensure that they understand degree
requirements. It is recognized that many students may not have decided on their major areas or on their
final career goals prior to entering University. Consequently, it is not unusual for students to change their
programs of study after taking several courses. Every effort is made to assist such students, within the
limits of the requirements of the various programs.

Students who are considering program changes may request assistance from advisors within their
proposed area of study. Application forms for a change of program are available on the web on the
Student Self Service page.

Students are required to have declared a major by the time they have successfully completed ten
semester courses.

CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS
A full-time student is one who is registered in four or more undergraduate courses in a term.

A part-time student is one who is registered in fewer than four undergraduate courses in a term.

A regular student is one who has met the average requirements for admission or the minimum average
requirements for continuation in his or her program of studies.

A conditioned student is one who, at the time of admission, does not have standing in a required subject
or subjects.

A visiting student is one who registers and takes courses for credit for the purpose of transferring the
credit to the university at which he or she was previously registered. Normally, visiting students are
advised to have written permission from the home university in order to register for courses.

A special or non-degree student is one who is taking courses for credit but not proceeding to a degree at
this University.

An audit student is one who attends (a) course(s) but does not receive any grade(s) or credit for the
course(s) towards a degree. Such a student will not be allowed to write examinations and may not be
graded in any way, but will be required to pay the regular fees for the course(s).

A student on academic probation is one who has not met the full admission requirements to a program
or a student who, once admitted, has shown unsatisfactory progress at the conclusion of the previous
term. (See the regulations pertaining to each Faculty.)

Academic probation is removed if a student demonstrates satisfactory progress by the end of the
probationary period. Normally, a student will be required to withdraw from a faculty if performance is
not satisfactory at the conclusion of the academic probationary period.

For regulations pertaining to the possible readmission of students who have been required to withdraw,
see the regulations pertaining to each Faculty.

COMBINED MAJOR
Students wishing to combine two areas of study from the Arts, Languages, Social Sciences, or Science
within a single four-year Honours B.A. or B.Sc. program may do so if the areas of study concerned have
provided for this possibility in their respective sections of the Calendar. Such programs require a total of
forty courses including the successful completion of degree requirements as defined by each area of
study in the appropriate section of the calendar. The area of study selected as the first major will
determine the degree awarded. (e.g., BA in English and Chemistry, or BSc in Chemistry and English).

COURSE CONTENT
Information regarding the content and the hours of instruction per week for all courses is to be found in
the individual subject area listings. The time schedule for classes can be obtained online at the Office of
the Registrar at www.uwindsor.ca/registrar. The University does not attempt to impose uniformity in
methods of course presentation. Therefore, methods of course presentation vary and may involve
lectures, lectures combined with class discussion, small group or tutorial instruction, seminars, or other
combinations of the above. In all cases, the method(s) to be used will be explained early in the course.

COURSE NUMBERING FRAMEWORK
Each course is identified by a subject code and a number code. The subject code consists of 4 alpha
characters that identify the discipline. The number code consists of 4 numeric characters with the first
digit designating the year/level of study. The series 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 numbers are intended to
indicate progressively more demanding content and correspondingly increasing background and
competence on the part of the students enrolled in the course. Numbers in the range 1000-1999 are
ordinarily used for the introductory courses in most disciplines. Within the range, however, a lower
number does not necessarily signify more elementary content. It is important that students planning
their courses have clearly in mind the significance of these numbers so that they may guard against
undertaking course work at levels for which they are insufficiently prepared. A number of courses have
stated prerequisites which are prior requirements for entry to a course. Students who do not satisfy the
prerequisite for a course, or who in the opinion of the instructor do not possess an equivalent
background to that of the stated prerequisite, may not register for the course, and may be removed if
they register inappropriately.

DEFINITION OF COURSES AND SESSIONS
The word "course" generally refers to a 3.00 credit hour offering which is given over one term. Each term
includes approximately twelve weeks of classes. During each regular academic year (September to April),
the Fall term runs from early September to early December and the Winter term runs from early January
to mid-April. Each term concludes with final examinations. Additionally, the University schedules courses
in a Summer term which includes Intersession (May - June) and Summer Session (July - August), each of
which are approximately six weeks in duration. Courses given in these sessions carry the same credit as
those in the Fall and Winter terms. Some courses offered in the Summer Term run from May - August (12
weeks).

In some areas, courses also may be offered for 1.50 credit hours, or for 6.00 credit hours. Courses of any
credit hour value may be offered over multiple terms or over a part of a term.

In a few cases a course may be "linked" with another course in the sense that credit is granted only when
both courses have been completed successfully. Course descriptions indicate "linked" courses. Unless
otherwise indicated, such courses must be taken in successive terms.

The time required to complete programs can vary according to the student's choice. If courses are taken
exclusively in the Fall and Winter terms, a general degree normally is completed in three years and a
four-year Honours, Major or professional degree in four years of full-time study. Students may choose to
accelerate their programs by attending Summer term, Intersession and/or Summer Session, or may
spread their programs over a longer period by attending as part-time students. Some programs place a
time limit on degree completion. Refer to individual Faculty and program regulations for such limits.

achieve a cumulative average of at least 83%.

Board of Governors In-Course Medals
These medals are awarded annually, at the end of the Winter term, to the undergraduate student in each
Faculty who had the highest cumulative average of all non-graduating students in that Faculty. A
minimum cumulative average of 78.5% is required. The student must have completed the equivalent of
at least ten courses at the University and must be registered full-time in an honours degree program.

GRADUATING "WITH DISTINCTION"/"WITH GREAT DISTINCTION"
Students in first-entry degree programs or certificate programs who graduate with a cumulative average
from 80% to 89.9% will receive their degree or certificate "With Distinction". Students in first-entry
degree programs or certificate programs who graduate with a cumulative average from 90% and above
will receive their degree or certificate "With Great Distinction".

APPLICATION FOR GRADUATION
Registration in any program does not constitute an application for a degree, certificate, or diploma. An
official application for graduation must be filled out regardless if you are planning on attending/not
attending the graduation ceremony. (Log into UWinsite Student at
http://www.uwindsor.ca/registrar/uwinsite-student)

The deadline date to submit an application to graduate is March 1 for Spring Convocation and August 1
for Fall Convocation. In cases where credit is sought for work done elsewhere, all official transcripts or
other documents as required by the Registrar's Office, but not already submitted, must be conveyed to
the Registrar's Office no later than six weeks before Convocation. Failure to comply with these
regulations will disqualify the student from graduation at the Convocation concerned (see the Policy on
Standing Required for Continuation in Programs and for Graduation which can be found on the Central
Policies website at: www.uwindsor.ca/policies).
INTERDISCIPLINARY                                                               HEALTH
SCIENCE
Students with education and training in the health sciences are well-prepared for a plethora of careers
ranging from health promotion specialists, data analysts, health policy analysts, and health care
administrators, and are well-positioned for professional degrees and graduate programs.
Interdisciplinary Health Sciences (IHS) Stream that will support the need for trained individuals with
knowledge of heath, wellness, and illness from multiple perspectives (e.g., biological, behavioural, social,
environmental).

The following are the core courses available for the Stream:

Concentrations:
The concentrations have been developed by the contributing departments and include courses that they
view as being directly or indirectly relevant to some aspect of the health sciences. As noted, the ‘core’ of
the IHS program will ensure that the topics explored through the concentrations are related back to
modern healthcare and the student’s health-related major. In this respect, the ‘core’ courses are key to
meeting the learning outcomes for each concentration.

Discovery Program (undeclared majors in FAHSS)
Students who have not decided on a major may remain undeclared until they have completed ten
courses at the University of Windsor. These students will be placed in the Discovery Program.

The Discovery Program provides for undeclared students a home in their first year at university while
they are discovering their preferred major. The “Effective Writing” courses required in this program will
give them a solid foundation for the extensive amount of written work they face in courses they take
throughout their university career. “Understanding the Contemporary World” will guide them into
thinking critically while examining a variety of topics from several points of view. Students will receive
attention to help them achieve academic success and the possibility for success after graduation.

Students in the Discovery Program (undeclared majors) must take GART-1200 Understanding the
Contemporary World and GART-1500 Effective Writing in the Fall Semester of their first year, and GART-

ANTHROZOOLOGY COURSES
ANZO-1600. Animals and Humans in Society
This course will explore and consider the different types of relationships between animals and humans in
contemporary society from a variety of physical, social, and psychological perspectives. Topics may
include companion animals, animal rights and welfare, animals and food and entertainment, human-
animal violence, and animal-assisted therapy. (Can be taken for either Social Science or Arts credit).

ANZO-2000. The Paw and the Pen: Animals in Literature
This course explores the varying and significant ways in which animals are represented in literature.
Throughout Western literary history, animals appear in a variety of images, symbols, characters, and
themes, which can be studied from a wide array of critical perspectives: natural realism; animal society;
anthropomorphism; pests vs. pets; “owned” beings vs. companions; ecocriticism; cultural icons; and

General Information
The study of history provides skills essential to many careers - in teaching, law, business, museums,
journalism, or public service. It develops critical thinking, research, and writing skills, using both old and
new technologies, in a small department with ready access to professors. History is also fascinating in
itself, offering a window on various groups and perspectives that shaped the past, both in Canada and
comparatively across the globe. Finally, studying the societies, politics, and ideas of past times sharpens
the historical memory we can bring to issues of the present, informing and inspiring an active citizenship.

United States in 1776 to the Confederation of Canada in 1867. Specifically, it examines the interactions
between the various colonies that made up British North America (Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, Newfoundland, Lower Canada, Upper Canada, British Columbia, and Vancouver Island) and
the northern United States. Using a continental approach to Canada’s history in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, this course focuses on these cross-border links. It addresses many topics, including
colonial wars, political loyalties and cultural identities, migration, trade, diplomacy, American
perceptions of British North America and its residents, and the transnational origins of Canadian
Confederation. (This is an experiential learning course.)

HIST-4620. Global South Encounters
The expansion of United States’ power throughout the Global South (emphases may vary according to
the expertise of the professor, but will include consideration of the Americas, Africa, the Indo-Pacific and
the Middle East) from the late eighteenth century to the present. Topics will include transcontinental and
overseas expansion, colonial warfare and resistance, the construction of racial and national identities,
gender in an imperial context, and borderland cultures (Prerequisite: Restricted to History majors and
other students with at least semester 5 and permission of the instructor.) Seminar (3 hours/week). (This
is an experiential learning course.)

HIST-4630. History of Gender and Sexuality
This course explores major themes in the history of gender and sexuality. These may include
reproduction, contraception, and abortion; gender, race, and power; sexuality and the state;
heterosexual relations and marriage; gay, lesbian, and transgender identities. Time period and
geographical region will vary with the instructor.)(Prerequisite: Semester 5 or above standing and one of
HIST-2490, HIST-2500, or HIST-2510/WGST-2510 or permission of the instructor.)(Also offered as
Women's and Gender Studies WGST-4630.)
HIST-4660. History in the Movies
This course treats films as historical documents through which to lens broader social and cultural
phenomena. Distinct from film history, that is the study of the history of cinema, the course pairs more
“traditional” historical research materials, such as academic historical writing and primary
documentation, to what became the dominant cultural medium of the 20th century. Films function as
both historical artefacts (objects implicitly capturing moments in time) and as historical narratives
(mediums explicitly disseminating points of view relevant to the time of production). Engaging with them
at both levels, students will be expected to examine the experiences, values, politics, and social identities
within a particular period (such as 1970s America) or as related to a specific historical theme (gender, for
example) as a means of better understanding the history of the subject. (The topic will vary with the
instructor and may be re-taken by permission of History’s undergraduate coordinator.)

HIST-4800. Public History
This course explores the theory and practices of Public History, including the ways in which History is
communicated to the wider public by museums, cultural institutions, heritage sites, archives, film, social
media, advertising, and national parks. Topics may include approaches to digital history, curating,
digitizing archival documents, and exhibit design and presentation. (Prerequisite: Semester 5 standing or
above.)

HIST-4810. Public History Practicum
This practicum provides students in the History program with the opportunity to apply learned concepts
and theory to a practical setting and become further familiarized with an area of interest in Public
History. Students will be placed in organizations in the Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent regions related
to their area of interest in Public History (e.g., museums, historical societies, heritage sites, etc.), and will
be expected to dedicate a total of 100 hours to both in-class and on-line learning, and practicum
components of the course. The course is open to History majors only. (Prerequisites: HIST-4800 and
minimum average in History courses of 75% or permission of instructor). (This is an experiential learning
course.)

HIST-4820. Making Historical Documentaries
A project-based, seminar-workshop on issues and problems specific to the historical documentary genre
in which students research, write and make a short historical documentary film (or video). Study of
methods and practices for incorporating historical elements into documentary, and analysis of traditional
and experimental historical documentary practices. Student work will be developed through
presentation in a workshop environment. (Prerequisite: Semester 5 standing).

HIST-4830. Local History and Research Methods
This seminar-based course introduces students to the history of southwestern Ontario and metro Detroit
from the pre-colonial era to the twentieth century. It addresses many topics, including pre-colonial
Indigenous history, the founding of Detroit and the local French presence, political regime changes in the
eighteenth century and the creation of the border, Indigenous treaties and settler-Indigenous relations,
the War of 1812, slavery and the Underground Railroad, industrialization/ urbanization and
environmental history, cross-border economic and cultural ties, transportation, African Americans in
Detroit, immigration, and collective memories.

HIST-4970. Selected Topics in History
Topics of current interest which may vary from year to year. (May be repeated for credit with
permission of a program advisor.) (May be repeated for credit with consent of an advisor in History.)
(Prerequisite: Restricted to History majors and other students with at least semester 5 standing and
permission of the instructor.)


HIST-4990. Research Capstone Thesis
Students will receive training in the methods and skills of advanced historical research, ultimately
composing an undergraduate research thesis based on their own original research in the subject area of
the course as offered. In the first term of this two-term course, they will identify a practical research
topic, perform a review of relevant scholarly literature, and produce a research proposal outlining the
topic and identifying a body of relevant research materials, either in manuscript form or available digital
archives. In the second term, students will implement the research proposal, spending much of the term
engaged in original research. Having collected the relevant research materials, they will write, edit, and
revise their final research thesis, the cumulative exercise of the course. The course’s specific theme or
region/time-period will vary with the instructor. (Pre-requisite: At least Semester 6 standing, and 75%
average in History courses or permission of instructor.)

DISB-1000. Social Justice in Action
Students investigate the local and global origins of a contemporary social problem through the eyes of
social justice activists. Students will assess the strengths and limitations of strategies and theoretical
frameworks for social change and use this knowledge to create social action messages that raise public
awareness, influence government or corporate policy, or positively change attitudes and behaviours. (3
lecture hours per week.) (Also offered as SJST-1000.)

DISB-2010. Disability Studies: Theory and Culture
This course explores the multiple meanings of disability and emphasizes the lived experience and
knowledge generated by people with disabilities. It critically examines how Western economic, medical,
moral, and social norms produce social exclusion and marginalization. It introduces students to key
Disability Studies theorists, theories, and social justice models that resist ableism by addressing issues of
access, accommodation, cultural representation, and identity. This course uses an intersectional
framework to consider how variances in race, ethnicity, gender-identity, sexuality, class, citizenship, and
culture impact both individual and collective experiences of disability. It considers how Disability Studies
differs from other disciplinary approaches to disability, understands disability as a social construct, and
positions disability as difference rather than deficit.(Prerequisite: SJST/DISB-1000.)

DISB-3020. Historical Approaches to People with Disabilities
This course will select national and international milestones highlighting people, events, and legislation
that have affected disability rights. It will include historical discussions about significant dates related to
the eugenics movement, the civil rights movement, the self-help movement, deinstitutionalization,
demedicalization, and consumerism. Emphasis will be placed upon Canadian history with comparison
with historical developments in other countries. This course will expose current issues, controversies,
and trends in disability and teach students how to interpret historical documents, court cases, media
reports, and other materials. It will use case studies to analyze the ideological, socioeconomic, and
political history of disability. (Prerequisite: DISB-2010)
DISB-4010. Community Approaches, Advocacy and Empowerment
Students will critically review traditional approaches to professional practice with people with disabilities,
with special attention to the role of the professional. Using case studies, students will explore
professional intervention strategies that promote full participation and equality for people with
disabilities. Other themes include self-determination and choice, supporting disability rights and self-
advocacy organizations, and building alliances. Recognizing how important family is to many people with
disabilities, this course will also explore the implications of the views and experiences of family members.
Stressing the need for empowerment, this course introduces students to social change movements as led
by people in search of full citizenship who have disabilities. The implications for empowerment, created
by the advent of new technologies, is also explored. (Prerequisite for Social Work/Disability Studies BSW
students: DISB 2010. Prerequisite for all other students: DISB-3020.)

DISB-4020. Service Delivery Systems and Independent Living
This course helps the student understand how to put the social model of disability into practice. It will
encourage students to analyze power, inequality and influence and then to build strategies for actions. It
will promote a team-oriented approach by using case studies to examine the issues of access and related
policies and practices that support or impede inclusion. Theoretical and practical approaches draw from
the perspective that people supported by human services need opportunities to lead dignified lives with
the means to exercise greater personal choice, control and independence. The Independent Living model
and organization exposes students to multiple issues that involve the actions of consumer leaders,
activists and managers in designing, organizing and changing services and support models for people
with disabilities. This course considers how people with disabilities access societal and community
resources, engage socially, and take part in policy development and implementation.

This two course equivalent sequence is a field placement, designed to enable students to apply and
integrate the various theoretical perspectives and themes explored in the Disability Studies program
through implementation of a community based project. Students will work with people with disabilities
in community agencies and programs and develop respectful and empowering professional skills.
Students will also have the opportunity to gain knowledge of an issue or area of specific interest. This will
necessitate the development of an individual or group project of interest and importance to the
organization involved.(Prerequisite: DISB-2010, DISB-3020: Semester 7 standing in Disability Studies

1. Students are required to take courses in distinct areas of concentration while abroad. They will have
   their choice of taking three pre-approved courses in either “Literature” and/or “Linguistics” and/or
   “Culture” and/or “Civilization”. The specific courses taken in an area depend upon the availability of
   courses in the area at the host university and the student’s program concentration. As well, all
   students will be required to take two advanced language-training courses. These are standard and
   available at any exchange partner university.
2. Students in the Honours program that are unable to take the required courses abroad, for any reason,
   will be permitted to transfer to the General or Honours with SLE programs. The modular design of
   the Modern Languages curriculum (a common first two years curriculum) permits this transfer to
   another program without any loss in time or additional costs to the student.
3. Students also will register for the “Directed Studies Abroad” Distance Education courses. Students on
   exchange will be required to attend specific cultural events (museums; art galleries, etc.), participate
   in assigned activities and write reports on their experiences.

MACS 2140 and MACS-2150 for majors; or semester four standing for non-majors)

MACS-2500. Stories of the City
This course examines how cities are imagined, dreamed, planned, described, and remembered. Students
explore urban cultures, legends, scenes, and structures to discern how the spaces and rhythms of city life
are expressed through its literature, visual arts, films, sounds, architectures and other media. While the
course addresses urban disasters and achievements, it also investigates the everydayness of urban
existence. Classes respond with theoretical, creative and community-based research projects that foster
conversation and involvement with citizens.

MACS-2600. History of Photography
This course addresses the history of photography from a social and aesthetic perspective. With the
invention of photography in the nineteenth century, debates about subjectivity, truth, memory and
difference were radically re-framed. This course follows the emergence of photography in 1839 through
its development in the twentieth century, exploring its documentary and aesthetic roles in relation to
specific socio-historical contexts. The significance of technological innovations to image creation will also
be addressed.

MACS-2850. Learning by Living in an International Urban Setting
This course develops the capability to describe and reflect upon the everyday rhythms and challenges of
learning in a new culture and urban environment and finding expressive ways to communicate the
experiences and challenges of learning to others. As an exploration of living in a city outside Canada
students will examine films, literature, music, theatre, or other expressive forms that reflect its urban
life. Students will write weekly blogs about their own experiences, perceptions and understanding of
Italian culture and living abroad. Using old and new media, they will engage in a regular process of
designing, drafting, and redrafting stories and relating interesting experiences from their time abroad
that may be shared with their classmates, colleagues, family, and friends within an electronic portfolio.
As managers of their own e-portfolios, students will develop a learning record designed to exceed the
limits of the course. Regular assessment of the e-portfolio and its entries may be carried out by a small
team of faculty at Windsor. (Permission of the Instructor is required.) (Prerequisites: GART-1500 and

the present. The course charts the shifting boundaries of contemporary art including the impact of street
art, new media, craft and design on art practices in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Topics focus on
the relationship between contemporary art production and the social, economic and cultural shifts that
inform new movements. As most contemporary art strives to foster discussion and debate, students
learn how to assess which themes and movements align with their own interests. Research and writing
strategies focus on the development of informed critical language around contemporary art practices.
(Prerequisites: MACS 2450; or semester 4 standing for non-majors.)
MACS-3520. Techniques and Technologies of Urban Life
This course examines the relationship between technologies, the built environments of cities, and the
ways in which we experience, remember, connect and interact in urban spaces, places, and times.
Drawing on cultural theories and creative practices, students develop conceptual tools for the analysis of
different technologies, media, cultural artifacts, spaces, and social practices, as well as creative research
methodologies that use old and new technologies to question and document urban and suburban life.
(Prerequisites: semester 4 standing.)

MACS-3620. Contemporary Issues in Photography

histories of art, media, science, and technology. These interwoven histories are explored through case
studies of visual artists, filmmakers, musicians, and architects working between disciplinary and
technological boundaries. Students will investigate ways in which these artists and practitioners have
developed strategies across time to promote, test, evade, and challenge the social roles and forms of
emerging media and technology. Pre-requisites for Visual Arts majors: MACS 2140 and 2150;
prerequisites for non-majors: semester 4 standing.)

MACS-3910. Contemporary Architecture

affective conditions. In the context of the Windsor-Detroit border, students from the University of
Windsor compare viewpoints based upon the experience of living in a border culture. Seminars and field
trips address borders from a number of perspectives and contexts. Students look to historical and
contemporary ideas about borders that have been articulated in various disciplines: from political theory
and cultural geography, to urban planning, art, literature, architectural and spatial theory. (Open to
majors and non-majors.) (Prerequisites: MACS-2140 and MACS-2150 for all Visual Arts Majors and

SACR-3170. Humanitarianism and Counterinsurgency Warfare
Humanitarianism and counterinsurgency warfare are two sides of the same coin in the post-Cold War
global security paradigm. This course will examine how each became pillars of that paradigm:
humanitarianism as the ostensible commitment to save the victims of natural and political disasters
worldwide; and counterinsurgency warfare as the strategy both to eliminate criminal and terrorist
networks that challenge the legitimacy of the inter-state system and to “win the hearts and minds” of
local populations whom they threaten. In that context, the course will investigate responses to armed
insurrections as well as natural disasters, epidemics, and acute famines that, today, combine
humanitarian with militarized responses. The course will also consider how humanitarianism and
counterinsurgency warfare draw heavily on academic expertise (e.g. anthropology, sociology,
criminology, geography, history, political science, religious studies, and psychology), thus inviting the
controversial issue of the relationship between the scholar, the university, and the security apparatus.

Why do we need so much stuff and how has it changed over time? An examination of the representation
and interpretation of the material artifacts of culture in a global context, including theoretical
approaches to objects and cultural products way artifacts and objects are interpreted, used and
represented in our social and economic institutions, our everyday lives and in a global context. We ask:
What is the function of objects in contemporary capitalist societies? To what degree do we ‘need’ things
to make our way in the world? How do objects inform our social identities? The course draws on a
variety of theoretical approaches to explore the meaning, circulation and production of objects, including
the relationship of objects to consumption. Topics may include cultural products and commodities,

BUSINESS PROGRAM REGULATIONS
FOR ALL SPECIALIZATIONS
Students in the thesis option must complete BUSR-4950 and BUSR-4990. Students who have enrolled in
BUSR-4990 prior to Winter 2018 may substitute BUSR-4950 with a fourth-year research-based
independent study course.

Co-operative Education Program Regulations
The Business Administration Co-op Program will help students acquire valuable professional experience
in the workplace while they are pursuing their academic careers.

Students are admitted into the Bachelor of Commerce Co-op Program either directly out of their Grade
12 (or equivalent) Year, or in the Fall term of their second year of study in the Odette School of Business
Administration. The Co-operative option is not available for the Honours Business and Economics or the
Commerce for University Graduates program. Admission to the Program is competitive. Students
applying from secondary school will be admitted based on academic achievement (typically, a minimum
of 75% is required). Second-year students will complete a co-op application form and may be invited to
an interview.

Students admitted to the Program must maintain a major average of 70% or better and a cumulative
average of 65% or better, and must successfully complete three paid work terms to remain in the Co-op
Program. To remain in the Co-op program only one outstanding failing grade (grade below 50%) is
permitted.

Withdrawal from the co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined
that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must
meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may
withdraw from an undergraduate co-op program without further co-op fee payment implications is by
the 1st Friday of classes after their first co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative
Education at any other time will be liable for paying the co-op fee for the term in which they are
dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for
placement.

In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a co-op
employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a
position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once
students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in
the appropriate work term course and must remain in the co-op program until they have completed their
work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term
requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the co-op program and will result in a failing
grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

All Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the
University. The process of securing a co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work
opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software
program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek
co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process
facilitated by the Centre for Career Education.

The work/study sequence is as follows:

YEAR 1
Fall term: Study
Winter term: Study

YEAR 2
Fall term: Study
Winter term: Study
Summer term: Work

YEAR 3

FACULTY OF EDUCATION
GENERAL INFORMATION
History

The Faculty of Education, University of Windsor, was established on July 1, 1970, thus becoming the
seventh Faculty in the University. Its predecessor, Windsor Teachers' College, founded in 1962, trained
its students to teach in the elementary schools of Ontario. Integration with the University opened the
way to the development of new programs of study designed to prepare candidates for teaching in both
elementary and secondary schools.

The Role and Mission of the Faculty of Education

The Faculty of Education, University of Windsor, promotes the professional and scholarly growth of
teachers at all levels as reflective, caring, competent and innovative educators. We advance knowledge
and contribute to the improvement of pedagogical practice through our teaching, our research and
scholarly activities, and our community service and development. Our undertakings are informed and
shaped by a commitment to equity and social justice.

We approach teaching and learning primarily from a constructivist perspective, which builds upon the
philosophical principles of progressive education. Some key elements include student-centred active
learning, authentic activity, and integration of prior experiences. We are focused on providing
prospective teachers with what they need to know in order to teach diverse student bodies. We value
teaching in ways that emphasize the understanding of differences that may arise from diverse cultures,
family experiences, multiple intelligences, and learning styles. Informing the design of our pre-service
program are the following beliefs:
• effective teachers are able to work with students with a wide range of learning needs, including those
   with exceptionalities;
• teacher candidates learn best by doing and reflecting, collaborating with skilled professionals, and by
  sharing their experiences; and
• teacher candidates should be provided opportunities to develop a professional sense of
  accountability, which includes an understanding of the social and moral responsibilities that underlie
  the practice of the teaching profession.

The ultimate purpose of the Faculty of Education is to enable teacher candidates to prepare their
students to be responsible and productive citizens. We stress to our teacher candidates the importance
of recognizing the enormous influence they will have on students. They must continuously evaluate what
students are thinking and modify their plans to take into account what they discover. In this regard, we
promote the notion that teachers are powerful classroom ethnographers with the ability to analyse and
explain to themselves and to others why they do the things they do. We believe teacher candidates
should internalize the dispositions and skills needed to study their teaching and take responsibility for
their own professional development and lifelong learning.
GENERAL     REGULATIONS                                        AND               ENROLMENT

STANDING REQUIRED FOR CONTINUATION

Faculty Courses:
Teacher Candidates, who obtain three or more final grades below a 60-62.9% in any course in the
program, or one or more final grades of 0-49.9% in any course in the program, over the duration of the
program, will have failed the Bachelor of Education (BEd) Degree and will not be eligible for
recommendation to the Ontario College of Teachers for certification. In all such cases, upon a cumulative
academic record as defined above, Teacher Candidates will be required to meet with the Associate Dean,
Teacher Education immediately to review their academic standing, which may lead to the requirement to
withdraw from the program. Teacher Candidates may be provided with an opportunity to return to the
Faculty of Education to fulfill outstanding requirements for the completion of the BEd Degree. Conditions
of reinstatement are the sole prerogative of the Dean or her/his designate.

Practicum:
Each teacher candidate receives a final Pass/Fail grade for Practice Teaching (EDUC-5499). A pass is an
essential prerequisite for both the BEd degree and recommendation for certification to the Ontario
College of Teachers. The Pass/Fail determination is based on the Faculty Advisor’s Final Summative
Practicum Report/Portfolio Assessment, which documents the overall field experience using a range of
criteria. Satisfactory performance in practice teaching is essential for success.

Generally, in order to pass, a teacher candidate will have received “Satisfactory” Summative assessments
from the Associate/Mentor Teacher at the end of each placement. However, in cases where a teacher
candidate receives a “Borderline” Summative assessment in the first placement, but receives
“Satisfactory” Summative evaluations in all subsequent placements, the teacher candidate’s status will
be reviewed by the Associate Dean, Pre-Service. A teacher candidate who receives a “Borderline”
assessment in either of the final two placements will be required to complete an additional placement
and obtain a “Satisfactory” Summative assessment.

A teacher candidate who receives a Summative “Borderline” assessment will be notified in writing that
he/she is in danger of not meeting the standard required in order to obtain a Pass. Teacher candidates
who receive either two Summative “Borderline” assessments or one Summative “Unsatisfactory”
assessment have not met the standard required to obtain a Pass in EDUC-5499. All such cases will be
reviewed by the Associate Dean, Pre-Service, who will determine the next steps in the process.
Placements which are terminated by the school will be considered “Unsatisfactory.”

Practicum Failure
It should be noted that failure may result from any serious contravention of the Ontario College of
Teachers Standards of Practice and Ethical Standards for the Teaching Profession, including, but not
limited to:
• Professional misconduct during the practicum component of the Faculty of Education program;
• Academic misconduct during the practicum component of the Faculty of Education program; and/or

• An unsatisfactory portfolio assessment by the Faculty Advisor.

Failure for Cause
In certain circumstances a candidate may be deemed to have failed the Practice Teaching course, EDUC-
5499, for cause. Failure for cause may result from professional misconduct during the practicum and/or
gross neglect of teaching duties. All cases of this kind are referred for investigation and decision to the
Associate Dean, Pre-Service Education, who may refer the matter to the Professional Standards
Committee.

Sessional records
Sessional records include term assignments, oral and written tests, and practical work. The general
attitude of the candidate to his or her work, adaptability to teaching, and the probability of future
success as a teacher may be taken into consideration in determining sessional standing.

Final grades
Final grades awarded are based upon the accumulated evaluation of the candidate. Formal final
examinations may be held; however, no formal supplemental examinations will be allowed.

STANDING REQUIRED FOR GRADUATION
To complete the Bachelor of Education (BEd) Degree and be recommended to the Ontario College of
Teachers for certification, teacher candidates must meet the expectations in all areas of the pre-service
education program. This means that candidates must successfully complete their course work, field
experience (Each teacher candidate must receive a pass in EDUC-5499 as a prerequisite for both the BEd
degree and recommendation for certification to the Ontario College of Teachers), professional learning

• This program provides the preparation required for certification by the Ontario College of Teachers
  for teaching Technological Education in Ontario High Schools. The program is offered over the course
  of fourteen months with course work being held during two semesters in Summer I and Summer II of
  the program, and over the two semesters (fall and winter) between each summer. A practicum
  (minimum 80 days) at an Ontario High School and a service learning internship incorporating broad
  based technology skills are offered between September and June. Candidates may enter the program
  via one of four different pathways.
• Trade (3 years wage-earning) + 2 year College degree/diploma
• Trade (2 years wage-earning) + 3 year College degree/diploma
• Trade (X years wage-earning) + University degree (for a total of 5 years)
• Trade (at least 5 years wage-earning experience) + Ontario School Secondary Diploma (OSSD) or its

FACULTY OF ENGINEERING
PROGRAM INFORMATION
The engineering curriculum leading to the BASc degree has been designed to offer students an education
that is immediately valuable to them on graduation and which, at the same time, provides a foundation
to accommodate their further education in industry or research.

Those interested in pursuing graduate studies should consult the graduate calendar information on the
Integrated BASc/MASc program.

The first year is common in order to give the student an introduction to general engineering principles
and to allow investigation of a special field of interest for subsequent years of study.

The Co-operative Education Program is available in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering,
Environmental Engineering, Industrial Engineering (with or without a minor in Business Administration),
and Mechanical Engineering (with or without an option in Aerospace, Automotive, Materials or
Environmental).

While engineers must work within the technologies of the times, they are also responsible for the
continual development of these technologies. The flexibility demanded of the engineer must be based
upon proficiency in the physical sciences, and a confident ability to apply the sciences to the benefit of
humankind. Therefore, our engineering programs are founded upon a substantial content of
mathematics, physics, and chemistry; and our engineering subjects are taught with a view to familiarizing
the students with contemporary practice, and teaching them those methods of analysis, design, and
realization which they will be able to apply to a continually developing discipline.

The aim of the engineer is to apply the latest science and technology for the betterment of society;
engineers must, therefore, realize their duties to society and, as a prerequisite, appreciate how
civilizations have developed to their present states.

The independent responsibility that we wish to see in practicing engineers is impressed upon our
students by emphasis on laboratory work, tutorials, projects, and assignments. Further, the student is
assisted in individual studies by counselling and professional development seminars.

These activities encourage a close and profitable student professor relationship and facilitate the
interchange of engineering information and experience to develop the professional maturity and
integrity of the student.


ACADEMIC REGULATIONS
Students are directed to become familiar and to comply with the general regulations of the University
which apply to all students. Additionally, programs within the Faculty of Engineering have particular
regulations. Students enrolled in Engineering programs also must comply with these particular
requirements.

Students also are directed to read the "Statement of Responsibility".
COURSE CHANGES
All course changes subsequent to registration require the written approval of the Associate Dean of the
Faculty.

COURSES NOT PART OF THE ENGINEERING PROGRAM
A student may register for courses additional to those in the Engineering program only with the
permission of the Head of the department in which the student is enrolled and the Associate Dean.

SUPPLEMENTAL PRIVILEGES
The Academic Standing Committee may grant a supplemental evaluation privilege for a failed course
provided that the student:
(a) has failed only one course in the evaluation period; and
(b) has a grade below 50%; and
(c) has a cumulative average of 60% or better.

If a supplemental evaluation privilege is granted and the student decides to exercise this privilege, the
student must register for the supplemental and pay the appropriate fee. Once a student has registered
for a supplemental evaluation and the required evaluation method has been prescribed, the evaluation
will occur at the time and place prescribed by the Faculty of Engineering. Failure to write after registering
for the supplemental evaluation will result in a failing grade being assigned. Both the resulting grade and
the original grade will be shown on the student's transcript and will be included in the determination of
the student's cumulative average.

GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS
In addition to complying with the general university regulations an Engineering student must complete
the program within eight years of study from the date of first registration in an Engineering program.


CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM
The Faculty of Engineering Co-operative Education Program offers students the opportunity to combine
their classroom experiences with career-related work experiences. The Co-operative Education Program
is based upon the principle that the preparation of undergraduate Engineering students can be enhanced
by blending career related work experience with a quality curriculum.

Admission to the Co-operative Education Program is competitive. Students who apply and are accepted
into the Program must successfully complete three or four paid work experiences, normally interspersed
throughout the four-year honours program, in addition to specified program requirements. The
experience gained while participating in these structured and supervised work placements is viewed as
an integral component of the student's education program.

Industrial Engineering students have to take an internship position, of at least three (3) terms in duration,
to fulfil the requirements.

Note: Under extenuating circumstances, first year Engineering students may be considered for a co-op
term in their first year at the discretion of Faculty of Engineering.

APPLICATION PROCEDURE
Students can apply for the Co-op program directly out of high school via the OUAC application form. The
Co-op portion of the degree will begin in the fall of 2nd year. Students who were not admitted and/or
did not apply to Co-op directly out of high school can apply for the Engineering Co-op program in
September of their 2nd year of study. Second-year co-op applications are available through the Co-op,
Career and Employment Services Office.
Withdrawal from the co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined
that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must
meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may
withdraw from an undergraduate co-op program without further co-op fee payment implications is by
the 1st Friday of classes after their first co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative
Education at any other time will be liable for paying the co-op fee for the term in which they are
dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for
placement.

In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a co-op
employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a
position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once
students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in
the appropriate work term course and must remain in the co-op program until they have completed their
work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term
requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the co-op program and will result in a failing
grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

CO-OP JOB SEARCH PROCESS
All Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the
University. The process of securing a co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work
opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software
program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek
co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process
facilitated by the Centre for Career Education.

ACADEMIC STANDING
Co-op students must have: 1) a minimum cumulative average of 70% at the end of Year 1 of Engineering
studies; and 2) be eligible for 2nd year standing, or at the discretion of the Faculty of Engineering. Should
the number of eligible coop applicants exceed the number of available coop placements, the allocation
of available coop placements will be decided on the basis of academic merit (cumulative Year 1 average).
Successful coop applicants must maintain a minimum 60% in years 2, 3 and 4 to continue in the Co-op
program.

WORK TERM EVALUATION
A student's performance in a Work Term will be evaluated as either "Pass" or "Fail". To obtain a "pass"
evaluation, a student must successfully complete all the requirements of the Co-operative Program as
described in Co-op Commitments and Expectations provided to all co-op students and available from the
Co-op, Career and Employment Services Office.

CO-OPERATIVE PROGRAM GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS
In addition to the requirements for graduation from the regular B.A.Sc. program, students in the Co-
operative Program must satisfactorily complete three work terms, unless a student is involved in an
internship which is approved for different specific conditions.

Bachelor of Applied Science in Environmental Engineering
The program in Environmental Engineering is built upon a broad base of science and mathematics
combined with an emphasis on engineering principles and design.
The rapid growth of industrial activities has produced many new problems related to environmental
protection, resource conservation, and safety. The public has been aware of the risks involved in
handling a wide range of hazardous and toxic materials by major incidents which have occurred in spite
of improved design methods and operating techniques to overcome potential problems. Consequently,
legislation is being formulated and enacted to control the release of toxic chemicals and pollutants into
our environment. Environmental engineers are trained not only to solve problems of immediate concern,
but also to develop practices and processes to systematically avoid their occurrence.

Environmental engineers have qualifications which will permit them to focus upon the transport,
transformation and removal of contaminants in air, water, and soil, as well as the broader aspects of
environmental planning and impact assessment.

Note: The baccalaureate degree program in Environmental Engineering is accredited by the Canadian
Engineering Accreditation Board of the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers. With appropriate
selection of electives, students would be qualified to apply to medical schools.

ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER
ENGINEERING
Program Regulations and Information
Electrical Engineering encompasses a large number of exciting and diverse areas of study. Areas such as:
electronics, computer systems and networks; communications; energy systems; computer-aided design;
control systems, robotics and multimedia are only a few of the directions that Electrical Engineering
students can choose after graduation. The program of study includes co-operative work terms for
qualified students that are designed to enhance the knowledge and professionalism of the student.

The program of study encompasses courses outside Electrical Engineering and provides a professional
education sufficiently fundamental in nature so as to allow the student to choose his or her specific area
of professional specialization after graduation. This philosophy of education recognizes that the
professional responsibilities of graduate engineers evolve throughout their careers. Student may select
from the list of approved courses from within Engineering during the fourth year so as to meet their
needs more effectively.

Graduates of this program are able to engage, from the outset of their career, in decision making with a
much broader perspective than is possible when excessive specialization at the undergraduate level is
permitted. The program of study also provides excellent preparation for those students who may wish to
continue their formal education with graduate study and research.

Students must participate in a fourth-year team-based capstone design project that develops leadership
skills and professionally maturity. Students are encouraged to participate in seminars and in other
professional development activities as organized by the Department, as well as off-campus professional
activities. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has an active student chapter on
campus which includes a Women in Engineering AffinityGroup (WIE).

Note: The baccalaureate degree program in Electrical Engineering is accredited by the Canadian
Engineering Accreditation Board of the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers.

PROGRAM INFORMATION
Students may take a regular program in Mechanical Engineering or in Industrial Engineering. They may
also specialize in Engineering Materials, Aerospace Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Automotive
Engineering, or Industrial Engineering with Minor in Business Administration as described below.

The baccalaureate degree program in Mechanical Engineering is accredited by the Canadian Engineering
Accreditation Board of the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers. Mechanical engineers are
responsible for the design, construction, maintenance, and operation of machines and systems of
machines. They create, plan, research, supervise, analyze, and generally act as the professionals of
mechanical technology.

The mechanical engineer's knowledge and skills are needed in many industries, such as: heating,
ventilating, and air conditioning; transportation; power generation and distribution; metal production
and processing; manufacturing; and chemical and electrical equipment. Mechanical engineers commonly
go beyond the limits of purely mechanical work. They are found at all levels of management in private
industry and the public sector.

Students in the regular program specialize by selecting six courses from those offered in the areas of: air
conditioning; dynamics and stress analysis; vibrations and noise; and gas dynamics and turbomachinery.

which demand exceeds supply in industry, manufacturing and business organizations world wide.
Examples of manufacturing assignments held by our alumni include the areas of Product Engineering,
Process Engineering, Plant/Facility Engineering, Tool Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Human
Factors. Business organizations such as banks, railroads, petroleum, airlines, insurance companies, and
hospitals are also employing our graduates to manage and improve performance of their operations. Our
graduates are employed all over the world, in all levels of management and responsibilities. The
department has a tradition of highly successful co-op internship education programs with local business
and industry in Canada, the United States and the European Union. These activities expose students to
applied aspects of their research programs and help them establish strong contacts with potential
employers in relevant fields that include design and manufacturing at several local corporate
headquarters such as Ford, General Motors, DaimlerChrysler, Toyota, Honda, VW Audi. The combination
of real industry experience, cutting edge research and a curriculum that delivers the skill needed by
employers provides exceptional value and our degree is valued by others. Enrolment in the programs is
competitive and the department welcomes new student applicants who have a drive to succeed and are
prepared to be challenged to top performance.

Students may enroll in a general Industrial Engineering program or a Minor in Business Administration.

Co-operative Education Program Regulations
The Co-operative Education Program is designed for highly motivated students who wish to develop their
skills, increase their knowledge, and gain career-related experience. Students may apply into the
Bachelor of Human Kinetics (Honours Kinesiology – Movement Science) Co-op Program or the Bachelor
of Human Kinetics (Honours Sport Management and Leadership) Co-op Program following the
completion of their first term of study. There are 25 available Co-op openings for each application cycle.

The following criteria have been established to evaluate such applications:
1) academic achievement based on first term of study;
2) previous volunteer and paid work experience;
3) an application form and resume;
4) an interview with the student.

Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined
that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must
meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may
withdraw from an undergraduate co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by
the 1st Friday of classes after their first co-op work term. Students who withdraw from the Co-op
program at any other time will be liable for paying the co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping
and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement.

In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op
employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a
position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once
students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in
the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed
their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term
requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the co-op program and will result in a failing
grade on the student’s transcript for that work term.
Students must register during their work terms in KINE-2990, KINE-3990, and KINE-4990 successively.
Each work term will be graded on a Pass/Fail basis as a result of the successful completion of each of the
following:
• Submission of learning objectives approved by the employer
• Work term assessment evaluation by the employer
• Final employer work term evaluation
• Work term report evaluation by faculty and by the employer
• Work term presentation evaluation by faculty

All Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program, and approved by the
University. The process of securing a co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work
opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software
program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek
co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process
facilitated by the Centre for Career Education.

A Co-op fee is charged in each term beginning with the Winter term of Year 1. The fee is not a job-
placement fee, but is levied to help defer the administrative costs associated with the program.

concept emphasizing social and personal resources as well as physical capacity. Health is the goal of all
nursing behaviours.

INDIVIDUALS
Individuals are unique holistic persons with inherent dignity and are worthy of respect and care.
Individuals have freedom of choice and are accountable for these choices. Individuals are capable of
entering reciprocal caring relationships which foster health, growth, and self-actualization.

NURSING
Nursing is a humanistic, caring process, the goal of which is to help individuals, families, groups, and
communities achieve and maintain an optimal level of health consistent with their abilities and desires.
Nurses, in collaboration with members of the health team and other service providers build on strengths
and address health variations to facilitate client maturation and adaptation.

LEARNING/TEACHING
Learning is an individualized activity and involves learners' personal goals, perceptions and unique
learning style. Learning is goal oriented and an active life-long process of change and development.
Teaching is a facilitative process through which learners are guided and supported. It involves
communication, clearly defined goals, appropriate learning activities and a climate conducive to growth.
The curriculum is multi-disciplinary and aims to provide the learners with opportunities for intellectual

PROGRAM REGULATIONS
Students must become familiar and comply with the general regulations of the University, which apply to
all students. Additionally, students must comply with the regulations particular to Nursing programs
within the Faculty of Nursing.

1) For promotion and graduation, nursing students are required to achieve a minimum grade of a 60% in
each nursing course for which a numerical grade is provided and must achieve a “pass” in each clinical
course Students must maintain both cumulative and major averages of at least 60%.

2) Students who fail a clinical course may require remediation in a lab or clinical setting prior to re-taking
the course to ensure competence for safe practice at the expected level. Clinical courses in the nursing
program require the application of theory to practice. Therefore, a student who fails a required theory
course may be advised to repeat its paired clinical course to ensure continuing safe clinical practice:

3) Students will be required to withdraw from the Nursing Program if they have failed three required
nursing courses, or if they have failed the same required nursing course more than once. Students with a
cumulative or major average of < 55% (or < 50% for first year students) will also be required to withdraw
from the nursing program (For further information, see Standing Required for Continuation in Programs
at www.uwindsor.ca/policies)
4) Students who wish to repeat a previously passed nursing course for any purpose may be permitted to
do so only if there is space in the course with approval. Students are not encouraged to repeat previously
passed courses.

5) The program of studies for the four-year BScN degree must be completed within seven years from the
first Nursing course (NURS-xxxx) taken.

6) All option courses must be successfully completed prior to the start of Year 4 (NURS-4XXX).

7) Clinical placements will be arranged by the Faculty of Nursing to enable students to meet the Entry to
Practice expectations of the College of Nurses of Ontario.

conviction becomes known after admission to the program), they will be denied access to clinical
placements as per clinical placement agencies’ policies, and will be required to withdraw from the clinical
course.

12) Attendance at all clinical nursing practica and experiential learning laboratories is mandatory. Non-
attendance at a clinical placement by the University of Windsor's add/drop date for the semester will
require that a student withdraw from the clinical course. A student may not miss more than 20% of the
required hours in a clinical course. Time spent completing alternative learning activities will not be
counted toward the student’s clinical hours. A student who misses more than 20% of the required hours
will be required to withdraw from the course without academic penalty if they are otherwise in good
standing in the course.

13) To pass clinical courses, students must achieve all course learning outcomes.

14) Students are expected to attend clinical shifts as scheduled by the Faculty of Nursing. Shifts may be

Standing Required for Continuation in the BSc (General Science) Program
1) the minimum requirement for continuation "in good standing" in the General Science program is a
minimum cumulative average of 60% and a minimum average of 60% in the required Science courses of
this program.

2) If a student has not met the minimum cumulative and science course average requirements by the end
of the Summer or Fall term, the student automatically will be placed on probation.

3) If, at the end of the Winter term, a student has not met the minimum cumulative and science course
average requirements, the student's record will be referred to the Academic Standing Committee for a
decision.
  (a) If one average is at least 60%, but the other is between 55% and 59.9% (or if both averages are
       between 55% and 59.9%), the student normally will be allowed to continue on probation until the
       next evaluation period.
       By the subsequent evaluation period, both averages must be raised to at least 60% or the student
       will be required to withdraw.
  (b) If both averages are below 55%, the student normally will be required to withdraw.
  (c) If only one average is below 55%, the student may be required to withdraw.

4) A student who has been required to withdraw may not register in the Faculty of Science for twelve
months and may not apply for re-admission before the subsequent Summer term. The student must
apply for re-admission to the Faculty through the Office of the Registrar by the appropriate deadline date
for the term desired and must with the application include a statement of rationale and any
documentation of academic success attained elsewhere.

Readmission to the Faculty is not automatic and will be dependent upon the Academic Standing
Committee's assessment of the applicant's prospects for successful completion of the program. If
readmitted, the student will be placed on probation and must raise the cumulative and science course
averages to 60% by the next evaluation period and must satisfy any additional conditions of readmission
which may have been imposed. If the student fails to meet such requirements, he or she normally will be
required to withdraw. A student who has been required to withdraw a second time will not be eligible for
readmission under any conditions. Students receiving the BSc. (General Science) degree will have the
designation, "General Science" respectively indicated on their transcripts.

(excluding CHEM-4007), two of COMP-2067, MATH-2780, MATH-2790, PHYS-2200 or PHYS-3250.
*Through the completion of specific optional courses at St. Clair College, students can reduce the number
of required courses to 13:
• SCC MTH 605 (optional math course) credit towards UWin MATH 1720 or MATH-1760 and MATH-1730.
    At minimum, it is strongly recommended that students complete MTH 605 at St Clair College to ensure
    a seamless and efficient transfer pathway.
• SCC MTH 505 (optional math course) credit towards UWin MATH-1250
• SCC MTH 705 (optional math course) credit towards UWin MATH-2780
• SCC MTH 805 optional math course) credit towards UWin MATH-2790

Notes:
• Students wishing to complete a research project will also complete CHEM-4900 in addition to the
fulfilling the aforementioned degree requirements. However, this is a 6-credit course and so it would result
in those students taking a supernumerary course and complete an additional year of study.

REGULATIONS
ENGLISH PROFICIENCY
It is highly recommended that students take English ENGL-1001 (Composition) as students in Computer
Science should develop good oral and written communications skills, besides technical proficiency in the
basic science.

SELECTION OF COURSES
In selecting courses to meet the requirements of the programs outlined below, the following general
regulations also must be observed:

1) A student registering in a course without having successfully completed the prerequisite course(s) will
be required to drop that course unless the consent of the Director of Computer Science (or her/his
designate) is obtained.

2) If two or more courses cover essentially the same material, only one may be taken for credit.

3) The prior approval of the Director of Computer Science (or her/his designate) must be obtained in
order to substitute any courses for required ones.

4) Statistics courses other than those specifically listed as being required for the degree, or ones for
which the required statistics courses are themselves prerequisites, may not be taken for credit.
5) In general, Computer Science courses offered in other areas may not be taken for credit. COMP-1047,
COMP-2067, COMP-2057, COMP-2077, COMP-2707, and COMP-3057 may not be used to satisfy the
major requirements of any degree program in Computer Science, or in joint programs with Computer
Science, unless permission is obtained from the Director of Computer Science (or her/his designate).

CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION

The Co-operative Education Program is available for the following degrees:
Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours)
Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours Applied Computing)
Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Information Systems)
Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Science with Software Engineering Specialization)

Introduction
The Co-operative Education Program offers students the opportunity to combine their classroom
experiences with related work experiences. Students who apply and are accepted into the Co-operative
Education Program must successfully complete at least three paid work experiences interspersed
throughout the four-year Honours program. The experience gained while participating in these
structured and supervised work placements is viewed as an integral component of the student's
educational program.

All Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the
University. The process of securing a co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work
opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software
program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek
co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process
facilitated by the Centre for Career Education.

Academic Regulations
Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following:
(a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and
(b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%,
(c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and;
(d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period.

General Information
Withdrawal from the co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined
that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must
meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may
withdraw from an undergraduate co-op program without further co-op fee payment implications is by
the 1st Friday of classes after their first co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative
Education at any other time will be liable for paying the co-op fee for the term in which they are
dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for
placement.

In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a co-op
employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a
position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once
students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in
the appropriate work term course and must remain in the co-op program until they have completed their
work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term
requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the co-op program and will result in a failing
grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

(d) seven courses from any area.
For co-op stream, in addition:
(e) three co-op terms: PHYS-2980, PHYS-3980, PHYS-4980, (oral and written reports required). Students
must maintain major and cumulative averages of 65% or better to qualify for co-op placements.

All Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the
University. The process of securing a co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work
opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software
program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek
co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process
facilitated by the Centre for Career Education.

If a student has an outstanding commitment to an employer, then withdrawal from the co-op program
will be granted on an exception basis and will take effect following the work term. If a student
withdraws from an undergrad co-op program they will be subject to the following co-op fee payments:

If a student withdraws from co-op prior to the first Friday of classes of the semester following their first
work term, no further co-op fees will be charged once the withdrawal has been processed.
If a student withdraws from co-op after the first Friday of classes of the semester following their first
work term, they be liable for paying the co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one
additional term.

In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a co-op
employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a
position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once
students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in
the appropriate work term course and must remain in the co-op program until they have completed their
work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term
requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the co-op program and will result in a failing
grade on his/her transcript for that work term.
Recommended courses (if any): Students who intend to take additional mathematics courses are advised
to take MATH-1020 in first year. COMP-2120 is recommended. COMP-3400 and MATH-3590 are
strongly recommended. Students planning to pursue health professions should seek advice from an
academic advisor in the Department of Physics within the first year.

All Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the
University. The process of securing a co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work
opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software
program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek
co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process
facilitated by the Centre for Career Education.

Withdrawal from the co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined
that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must
meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may
withdraw from an undergraduate co-op program without further co-op fee payment implications is by
the 1st Friday of classes after their first co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative
Education at any other time will be liable for paying the co-op fee for the term in which they are
dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for
placement.

Education at any other time will be liable for paying the co-op fee for the term in which they are
dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for
placement.
In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a co-op
employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a
position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once
students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in
the appropriate work term course and must remain in the co-op program until they have completed their
work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term
requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the co-op program and will result in a failing
grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

Courses used to calculate the major average are: courses listed under requirement (a), and any courses
taken in the major area(s) of study.

The Schulich School of
Medicine and Dentistry –
Windsor Program
Launched in Fall 2008, the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry – Windsor Program is based on a
distributed medical education model involving a partnership between the Schulich School of Medicine &
Dentistry at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), the University of Windsor, and regional hospitals.
This partnership builds on the Southwestern Ontario Medical Education Network (SWOMEN) which was
initiated in 2002 to optimize medical education opportunities in the area and address the shortage of
physicians across the region. All students will be fully registered at UWO and will receive UWO degrees.

GLOSSARY
This glossary explains some terms which are used frequently throughout this Calendar. It is intended as a
quick-reference guide and may not necessarily offer the complete, official definitions and explanations as
they are applied to the University's programs and the administration of its regulations.

Antirequisite - A course or other level of attainment which, if already successfully completed, does not
permit registration for credit in another course, and which cannot be taken for credit concurrently with
that other course.

Attempt - Generally, any course for which a final grade has been assigned, including "WF" - Withdrew
Failing. Failures which are repeated and for which credit is subsequently earned may or may not be
considered as attempts, depending upon individual faculty regulations. If a student transfers from one
program to another, not all previous attempts necessarily will be counted as attempts within the
student's new program.

Bachelor's Degree (Baccalaureate) - The first university degree, for which a student follows a specific
undergraduate program (e.g., B.A.- Bachelor of Arts).

Certificate - At the undergraduate level, a program consisting of eight to twelve one-term course
equivalents in a specialized area(s) of study.

Corequisite - A course which must be taken concurrently with another course which lists it as a
corequisite.

Course - A unit of study identified by a course title and a unique course number. Unless otherwise
specified, the term "course" refers to a one-term, 3.0 credit course offering.

Two-Term Course - A course taught over two terms, usually the Fall and Winter terms. A two-term
course normally carries twice the credit value of a one-term course, or 6.0 credits.

Half Course - A course having a value of 1.5 credits. Half courses may be offered for fewer contact hours
per week over an entire term, or may be concentrated in either the first or the second half of a term.

Credit - A unit of academic value earned within a particular program. A credit value of 3.0 normally is
assigned to a one-term course. A two-term course, therefore, would have a credit value of 6.0; a half-
course 1.5.

Other credit values may be assigned. Some courses may be taken for varying amounts of credit within a
specific range (e.g. 2.0 to 9.0 credits); other courses may be offered for alternate credit values (e.g., 3.0
or 6.0 credits).

Credit values are used in the calculation of averages for academic standing and in the determination of
the student's year or level within a specific program. (See also "Weight").

Cross-Listed Courses - Courses which are listed under two different numbers in two different subject
areas. Cross-listed courses may be taken in either subject area, but credit may be earned in only one
course.
Cumulative Average - An average which is based upon all courses counted as attempts within a student's
career.

Diploma - At the undergraduate level, a program of study less extensive than a degree program, but
requiring more courses than a certificate program.

Full-Time Student - A student who is registered in four or more undergraduate courses in a term. (i.e.,
12.0 credits or more).

Linked Courses - Credit may not be allocated to certain courses until a subsequent course is also
successfully completed. Such "linking" of courses will be noted in the course descriptions.

Major - A formal, specific concentration of courses within a subject area as defined by its degree
program(s).

Major Average - An average based upon courses attempted within the student's major as defined by the
student's degree program.

Part-Time Student - A student who is registered in less than four undergraduate courses in a term (i.e.,
less than 12.0 credits).

Prerequisite - A course for which credit must have been earned prior to registration in another course
which lists it as a prerequisite. ("Consent of Instructor" may be listed as an alternative to, or in addition
to a given course prerequisite.)

Program - A combination of courses in a subject area (or areas) which fulfills the requirements for a
degree, certificate, or diploma.

Program Approval - For students in certain programs, consulting with and obtaining the signed approval
of course selections by a faculty advisor may be required as part of the registration process.

Registration - The process of selecting courses, obtaining faculty approval for course selections where
necessary, and making the appropriate arrangements with the University to pay the required fees.

Required Course - A course for which credit must be earned in a student's program.

Semester - Same as "Term" (see below).

Standing Required - Individual faculties and set out specific requirements which students must meet in
order to continue in their programs. These requirements normally include the maintenance of specific
minimum cumulative and major averages, and also place certain restrictions upon the number of courses
a student is permitted to have failed. Progress is reviewed at the end of each term.

Term - An academic period of twelve to thirteen weeks' duration. The Fall term extends from September
to December; the Winter term from January to April. Intersession, which extends for six weeks from mid-
May through the end of June, and Summer Session, which extends from the beginning of July to mid-
August are considered together as a single term.
Transcript - A document issued by the Office of the Registrar which records all aspects of a student's
registrations and grades obtained at the University. An "official" transcript is one which bears the official
seal of the University and which is sent directly to another institution or official of an organization.
"Unofficial" transcripts also may be issued to the student.

Withdrawal - A formal procedure set out within the regulations of the University for withdrawing from
an individual course(s), or from the University entirely.

Weight - For students registered in the Faculty of Engineering, the calculation of averages is based upon
a weighting factor. The weight of an individual course is equal to the number of lecture hours per week,
plus one-half of the number of laboratory and/or tutorial hours per week.

Year (or Semester) - Attaining a particular Year or Semester level depends upon earning credit for a
specific number of courses. The number of courses normally taken in one term/semester determines the
Semester level; the number of courses normally taken in a program over both the Fall and Winter terms
of a "regular" academic year would determine the Year level. In some programs, the attainment of a
specific level also may reflect the earning of credits in a particular group or sequence of courses.
